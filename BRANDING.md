## Core UX Concept

**Main Prompt**: "Add an image, add text or talk"

**Three Input Methods** (always visible):
- Image icon (slider/upload)
- Text input icon
- Microphone icon

**Interaction Flow**:
- Click any method → Area expands to show active input
- Multi-modal: Use one or combine all three
- Clear visual feedback for active/inactive states

**Auto-Processing**:

*Images*:
- Send to LLM immediately on upload
- Live event preview appears instantly
- Updates in real-time as more images added

*Text*:
- Auto-send while typing (debounced, every few seconds)
- Minimum character requirement before auto-send activates
- Send button shows if below minimum
- Button disabled if just sent (prevents spam)

*Audio*:
- Similar auto-processing behavior
- Live transcription and event extraction

## UX Philosophy

**Fast. Simple. Sweet. Reactive.**

**Intelligent Processing**:
- No waiting for button presses
- Smart detection of "enough data" to proceed
- Instant feedback as users interact
- Actions happen automatically when possible

**Dual Editing**:
- Edit generated event preview in real-time
- Edit inputs simultaneously
- Changes reflect instantly in both directions

**Version Navigation**:
- Slide back/forth between past generated versions
- History of all input iterations
- Never lose a variation
