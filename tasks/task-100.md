### Task 100: Preserve Unsaved Events During New Processing
- [x] Save unsaved events to local storage (temporary storage separate from history)
- [x] Modify batch processing state to preserve existing unsaved events when new processing starts
- [x] Update event list to append new events to existing ones instead of replacing
- [x] Load temporary unsaved events from local storage on page load
- [x] Only clear events from the "Made up events" section when user presses "Save" button
- [x] When saving: clear temporary storage for unselected events, add selected events to history
- [x] Ensure async/background processing doesn't interfere with unsaved events
- [x] Add real-time dynamic updates as new events are processed and added to the list
- [x] Keep existing history system untouched - only add newly saved events to it
