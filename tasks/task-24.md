### Task 24: Implement Simplified Batch Layout
- [x] Update header: "Batch Events (2)" → "2 Events" with selection indicator
- [x] Make event cards expandable for inline editing (click to expand, no separate button)
- [x] Add single primary "Export" button (black, bottom-right, only active with selections)
- [x] Add minimal "Cancel" text link (top-left or bottom-left)
- [x] Remove all count indicators from buttons
- [x] Auto-save to history when export succeeds (silent, no button needed)
- Location: `src/components/BatchEventList.tsx` and `src/app/page.tsx`
