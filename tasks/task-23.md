### Task 23: Simplify Batch Events UI
- [x] Remove redundant count labels from all buttons
- [x] Auto-select all events on batch import (remove "Deselect All" button)
- [x] Consolidate export buttons into single "Export" button (exports selected or all if none selected)
- [x] Remove "Save All to History" button (auto-save on export instead)
- [x] Replace "Bulk Edit" button with expand/collapse on each event card
- [x] Simplify to: checkbox list → expand to edit → Export button → Cancel
