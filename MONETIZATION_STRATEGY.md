# Event Every - Monetization Strategy

> A thoughtful, user-first approach to sustainable growth

---

## 🎯 Philosophy

Event Every exists to make event creation effortless. Any monetization strategy must:
- **Preserve the minimal, lovable experience**
- **Respect user privacy and time**
- **Provide clear, honest value**
- **Feel warm, helpful, and optional—never pushy**

Your users trust you to solve a problem. Our monetization should deepen that relationship, not exploit it.

---

## 💡 Recommended Monetization Model

### **Freemium + Usage-Based (Hybrid)**

This is the sweet spot for Event Every because:
- Your core costs are AI API calls (which vary by usage)
- Users get immediate value from the free tier
- Power users naturally need more, and they'll happily pay
- Aligns costs with value delivered

---

## 🆓 Free Tier - "Always Free"

**What's Included:**
- 5 events per month
- Image-to-event conversion (OCR + AI parsing)
- Text-to-event conversion
- Basic event history (last 30 days)
- Download .ics files
- All calendar format exports

**Why This Works:**
- Gives users enough to solve real problems (one event per week)
- Builds trust and habit formation
- Demonstrates full value of the product
- Covers casual users who never need more

**User Message:**
> "Event Every is free to use. Create up to 5 events per month, forever."

## 🎨 Ethical Advertising (If Needed)

Only consider ads if subscription revenue proves insufficient. If you must:

### **Sponsored Event Templates**

**How It Works:**
- Event management companies sponsor pre-made templates
- Users can optionally use branded templates
- Appears as "Sponsored Templates" section
- Never forced, always clearly labeled

**Example:**
- Eventbrite sponsors "Conference Template"
- Zoom sponsors "Virtual Meeting Template"
- Canva sponsors "Workshop Template"

**Revenue:** $500-2,000/month per sponsor

**User Experience:**
- Clearly labeled as "Sponsored by [Brand]"
- Enhances value (better templates)
- Optional and non-intrusive
- Maintains black & white aesthetic

---

### **Partner Event Suggestions (Very Light)**

**How It Works:**
- After creating an event, show 1 relevant suggestion
- "Planning a conference? Check out these Eventbrite events in your area"
- Affiliate link to partner

**Requirements:**
- Maximum 1 suggestion per session
- Must be genuinely relevant
- Easy to dismiss
- Never interrupts core workflow

**Revenue:** $0.10-0.50 per click (affiliate commissions)

---

### **What NOT to Do:**
- ❌ Pop-ups or interstitials
- ❌ Banner ads from ad networks
- ❌ Third-party tracking pixels
- ❌ Selling user data
- ❌ Intrusive video ads
- ❌ Anything that breaks the minimal UI

---

### **Gentle Upgrade Prompts**

**When users hit their limit:**
```
You've created 5 events this month! 🎉

You're getting great use out of Event Every.
Want to keep going?

[Upgrade to Plus for unlimited events] [Not now]

Or continue next month when your free events refresh.
```

**Tone:** Warm, congratulatory, pressure-free

---

### **Value-First Messaging**

Instead of:
> "Unlock premium features"

Say:
> "Create unlimited events and never lose track of anything"

Instead of:
> "Upgrade now"

Say:

---
